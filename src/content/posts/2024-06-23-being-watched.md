I am being watched. Playtime, mealtime, even bathroom time (seriously, that's just weird). I guess I don't mind it, though. Maybe they're taking notes? I know I do about them. ("Subject A: Often leaves kitchen cupboard opened. Will investigate later.") My only hope is they don't watch me sleep.

By the way, have you ever noticed how tasty those fake green plants look?

I'm feeling pretty good today, thanks to a glorious nap. I'm fully charged for whatever tonight's midnight mayhem brings.

### Gratitude List

Being a cat is not that bad. Before I was born into this furry form, I had my doubts. But so far, it's been pretty sweet. Humans seem to dig my look, though I'm not sure why they keep calling me "adorable." Whatever, I'll take the attention.

Here's what I'm feeling grateful for today:

* **My magnificent tail**: How can a single tail provide such endless entertainment? Though sometimes it feels like it has a mind of its own. I hope we get along.
* **My human servants:** They're pretty good at this whole caretaking thing.
* **A poop in peace**: Hey, a cat needs some privacy sometimes, okay?
