I am being watched. Seems likes humans like to observe my cat behaviours. They like to watch me play and eat. Sometimes they even watch me poop. A bit weird I would say, but I don't mind it. I wonder if they take notes about me, like I do about them. I just hope that at least they don't watch me sleep.

I noticed I'm attracted to green colour - those fake plants look really delicious.
