### Am I Growing Wiser?

My body keeps growing — I can't squeeze into my old hiding spots anymore! But am I getting wiser along with bigger?

I wonder... will I ever stop growing? Will I become even larger than my human companions? If I get big enough, maybe I can finally reach that snack shelf they keep pulling those delicious treats from. (I'm still not quite sure which of my behaviours they're rewarding, though. There must be a pattern.)

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* being rewarded with treats
* rewarding humans with my good behaviour
