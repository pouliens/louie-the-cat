Woke up at 6 am and made sure that humans are awake as well. They seem to respond to my cat noises quite well.

> It looks like I have a tail. It feels as if it has a mind of its own. No matter how hard I trie to catch it, it always seems to get away. But I will not give up.

Humans fed me some treats and trimmed my nails. They waited till I was about to go for my nap, so I'm less energetic to resist. They did a pretty good job. My nails looks nice now, and they don't get stuck anywhere. Afterwards I got more treats. I should get my nails done more frequently.

Spent the afternoon exploring the new surroundings and napping. Humans seem to like when I wake up. They enjoy my presence. Maybe I was a holy person in my past life.

It early evening now. Must go to sleep now, so I can wake up in the middle of the night and do some more cat stuff.
