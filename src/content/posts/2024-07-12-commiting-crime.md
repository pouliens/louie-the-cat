### Thrill of Mischief

Crime? What is it, really? Some things that bring me immense joy – nibbling on plants, leaping into wardrobes, plotting daring escapes into the "wild west" of the apartment hallway – seem to cause distress for my human companions. They don't share my enthusiasm for these little acts of rebellion. I wish they were a bit more adventurous sometimes.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* And endless number of crimes left to commit
* Committing a crime without being caught
* Getting treats despite being a criminal

*There's nothing better than taking a good nap after committing crime.*
