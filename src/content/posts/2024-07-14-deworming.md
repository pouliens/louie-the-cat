I had to undergo a rather unpleasant procedure today. They call it "deworming." As if I knew what that meant! Thankfully, they disguised the medicine in some truly delectable treats. My human companions seem to think I’m blissfully unaware of the ordeal, but I assure you, I am not.

Do humans deworm themselves? I mean, I eat and explore everything. The world is a buffet of textures and tastes, and I'll eat and lick anything I find. How could I not have picked up a worm or two along the way?

It's a curious existence, this one.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* world where worms exist
* the absence of worms in my body
