### Chasing My Tail

I often find myself trying to catch my tail. I keep chasing and chasing it, but I never seem to catch it. Sometimes I manage to squeeze it with my paws or bite it with my teeth, but it always escapes my grasp. 

It feels like that damn tail is always following me like a shadow. I might as well be trying to catch my shadow (which I sometimes do).

I wonder if my tail might actually be attached to my body. But that's crazy. We're too different to be part of the same body. I'm a rational, good natured cat, and *it* is crazy, unpredictable and I am starting to suspect it might be possessed by evil forces from some darker dimension.

As long as it keeps following me, the pursuit will continue. I hold onto the hope that one day I'll catch it and demand an explanation.

### Chasing God

But what if, in some strange twist of fate, my tail is a part of me? What else might I be connected to? The trees outside the window? The clouds drifting by? The stars glowing in the night sky? Where do I begin and where do I end?

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* **My tail:** a worthy enemy
* **Clouds in the sky:** for mesmerizing shapes.
* **Stars in the night sky:** for reminding me how big the universe is
