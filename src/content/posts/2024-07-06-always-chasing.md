### Always on the Prowl

Let's be honest, I'm hooked on the chase. My instincts won't let me ignore anything that zips by faster than a human stroll (though I'll admit, I sometimes go for those too). It's like a primal urge, a spark in my soul that compels me to pounce.

Who knows, maybe I was a predator in another life, tapping into those ancient hunting instincts. But honestly, I've probably been a million things before this.

Will the thrill ever wear off? It hasn't yet.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* The sheer joy of pursuit
* Catching things after a good chase
* The satisfying crunch afterward
