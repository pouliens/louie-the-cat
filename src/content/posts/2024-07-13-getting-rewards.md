### On the Simple Joys of Life

Boxes and bags... the source of endless joy. Give me a plain bin bag, a shoe box, an empty grocery bag – I'll transform them into my own personal playground.

I thinks the joy lies in the simplicity. And my needs are simple - I just need a few containers of varying sizes into which I can fit. It puzzles me why humans don't share this same delight. Perhaps they simply lack appropriately sized boxes and bags suitable for sitting. Or perhaps they've simply forgotten how to find joy in the simple things.
