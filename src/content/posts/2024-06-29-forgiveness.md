### No Room for Resentment in My Tiny Body

Sure, there are things that could ruffle my fur — hidden toys when I'm ready for play, humans bumping into me as I emerge from my secret lair beneath the sofa, or those forbidden zones in my home (what treasures do those rooms hold?). But truth be told, I don't think my body is capable of holding onto anger or resentment. It's a rather small vessel, you see, and there's simply no room for such heavy emotions.

My compact form needs to prioritise storage for those spectacular cat moves — the leaps, the pounces, the gravity-defying twists and turns - not to mention the other cat moves that make me look adorable to my human companions. Anger and resentment? They just don't seem like useful things to carry around. Sure, I might express a fleeting annoyance when the occasion arises, but then it disappears like smoke in the wind.

### Living in the Present Moment

Having a limited storage space for all of these emotions has its advantages. In the eternal now, there is only room for what's right in front of me, not what lies behind. It's freeing.

*Scaling new heights and letting go of old grudges.*

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* Eternal present moment which has no beginning and no end
* Capacity to forgive and forget
* Knowing what's important and what's not
