### Heeeelllooo, World!

Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to have a human face. Would it look silly on my furry little body? To be honest, I don't really know what my face looks like right now. Sometimes I catch glimpses of a kitten in the shiny thing humans call a mirror, and I'm like, "Who's that?" Then I realise... oh wait, that could be me?

What did my face look like before I was born, before I inhabited this cat body? Did I even have a face back then? So many questions...

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* **Other faces**: They help me tell my humans apart.
* **My face**: It's got some pretty useful stuff like eyes for seeing and mouth for putting some delicious snacks in my gob.
* **Evolution**: Thanks for inventing faces!
