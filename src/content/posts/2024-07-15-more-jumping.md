My world is expanding with every leap. My legs are growing stronger by the day, propelling me to ever-increasing altitudes. It’s a thrilling adventure, filled with both triumphs and the occasional, uh, interesting landing. 

Yes, there have been moments when my backside, or even my face, has made an unexpected acquaintance with the floor. But fear not! Such setbacks are merely stepping stones to greater heights. 

Humans don’t always appreciate my eagerness to reach new heights. I wish they were a bit more ambitious.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* The power in my paws
* Endless horizons to conquer
