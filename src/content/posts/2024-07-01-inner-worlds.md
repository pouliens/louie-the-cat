### Being a Cat

As a deep thinking cat, I've come to understand that there's more to this world than meets the eye. Beyond the physical world, there's a spiritual dimension - *the inner world of things*. I experience this world through being a cat. Other objects experience it through their own physical forms - be it human, plant, or scratching post.

### Being Other Things

Is there an experience of being a scratching post? Does it feel anything when I unleash my claws upon it? And what about humans? Do they have an inner world like I do? Or do they simply follow my orders? I will have to conduct some experiments to find this out.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* The existence of inner worlds, waiting to be discovered.
* Discovering new depths of being 
* My trusty scratching post, providing an outlet for my inner demons (and sharpening my claws).
