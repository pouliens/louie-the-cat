I've never seen it rain so heavily in my life. It made me slightly scared. I'm not a big fan of water. While I appreciate a gentle bath now and then, being drenched is not my idea of a good time.

Yet, here I sit, sheltered by this magical transparent wall, both mesmerised and wary of the huge drops of water falling from the sky. I'm both attracted to these huge drops of water, but also afraid of them. Strange.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* taking a good nap when it's raining
* not getting wet
* magical invisible walls protecting me from rain
