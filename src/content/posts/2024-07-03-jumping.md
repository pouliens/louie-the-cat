### Heading

Jumping is pure joy. The feeling of weightlessness, of defying gravity for a few fleeting milliseconds, is like being an astronaut exploring the vastness of space. Who doesn't love jumping?

Perhaps I got a little carried away today. All that soaring and landing led to a new experience: puking. It wasn't as bad as I expected. In fact, I felt lighter afterward, capable of even greater leaps.

I'm constantly expanding my jumping repertoire. Sideways jumps, backward jumps... the possibilities seem endless. What other strange and wonderful ways can I propel myself through the air?

*Taking a good nap after a lot of jumping. Still haven't puked yet. Still pure.*

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* The exhilaration of jumping.
* The satisfaction of landing exactly where I intended.
* The lightness that comes after puking
