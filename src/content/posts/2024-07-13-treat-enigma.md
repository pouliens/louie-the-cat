### Decoding the Treat Pattern

I noticed that some of my behaviours make humans behave extra affectionate to me - give me compliments, treats and rub my belly or that sweet spot behind my ears. I still don't get what causes it. Honestly, it seems a bit random. Is there some pattern that I don't see? What causes those delicious treats to come my way? I need to figure out this pattern. Better yet, I need to find where they get those delicious snacks and go straight to the source and get rid of the middlemen (aka the humans) entirely.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* humans
* treats
* humans giving me treats
