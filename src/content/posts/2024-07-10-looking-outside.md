I love looking outside. I don't even mind that shiny barrier that humans put in my way. But I still wish I could just go right through it. I suspect that in one of my past lives I was an astronomer - I used to spend my night looking at the night sky, trying to understand how the universe works. Now I do. But I have a more important purpose in this life. I need to figure out why this damn tail is always chasing me.


### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* Places without transparent barriers
* Sky that always keeps changing
* My tail, for keeping me company

*All the places I still have to explore.*
