### Alone Time

The first few days I stayed with my new humans, they were always by my side. It was quite pleasant to get all the attention at first, but I also need some alone time. 

They were quite worried about leaving me on my own. Do they think I'm not capable of taking care of myself? Perhaps they don't realise that my eight-week-old cat body houses a soul far older than this universe itself.

### Watching the Universe Being Born

Yes, in one of my recent naps, I experienced a profound vision. I stood outside the cosmos, witnessing its birth, before plunging into its depths and taking on this cat form.

And here I am now, chilling by myself while my humans are away doing their "human" business. I can do anything I want! I can run like crazy, I can jump on surfaces I'm not supposed to jump onto. I could even try to break into that big box humans call fridge. 

I'm probably going to take a good long nap. Maybe more mysteries of the universe will be revealed to me.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* That this universe exists
* Evolution produced this thing we now call life
* There are many different forms to inhabit here
