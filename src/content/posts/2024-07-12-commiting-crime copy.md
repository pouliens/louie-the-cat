### On the Simple Joys of Life

Boxes and bags... the source of endless joy. Give me a plain bin bag, a shoe box, an empty grocery bag – I'll transform them into my own personal playground.

I thinks the joy lies in the simplicity. And my needs are simple - I just need a few containers of varying sizes into which I can fit. I just don't understand why humans don't like to sit in bags and boxes. Maybe they don't make human sized sittable containers, or maybe they just don't like being happy.

*Humans are jealous because they cannot fit into any of these bags*
