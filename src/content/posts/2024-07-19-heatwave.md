The world has transformed into a fiery inferno. My luxurious fur coat, once a source of pride, has become a burdensome cloak. I am a prisoner in my own body, a feline trapped in a fur-lined oven. The only sanctuary is the unforgiving hardness of the floor tiles, a fleeting respite from the relentless heat. But I have to keep moving - keep finding more cool tiles - to prevent spontaneous combustion.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* Moments of cool relief.
* The absence of additional insulation.
