### Purrpose in Life

Do you sometimes ask yourself what is your purpose in this life? I do. I heard somewhere that your purpose in life should be a combination of something that you're good at, something other people need, and something you enjoy doing. I think that thing for me is spreading joy. 

### A Cat's Gift

Humans seem to like my company. I don't know what's so special about my presence - is it my body they like, my mind, or my soul or the timeless being that holds all of them together? 

As long as they need it, I will keep spreading it. It seems to come quite naturally for me.
