I get easily distracted by things. Life is just too interesting - there some many things to chase, so many gaps to try to fit into. Sometimes it’s not easy to stay focused on one task. My consciousness flows like water - it never stays too long in one place. It adapts to whatever is currently in front of it. Do I always live in the present moment? Have I reached enlightenment? Is cat form the ultimate form a soul can reach. Probably.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* Evolution of souls
* Living in the present moment
