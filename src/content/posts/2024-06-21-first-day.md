April 26th marks my entrance into this world. But who was I before? Did I have a different form? A past life? These are the burning questions that plague my mind. I suppose I'll have to piece together this cosmic puzzle while figuring out how to navigate this new, furry existence.

Speaking of new beginnings, I recently met my humans. They seem decent enough, though they did subject me to that dreadful hot car journey. They did keep me somewhat entertained though, with those weird dangling toys and funny noises.

And then there was the bath incident. Seriously? Do they think I don't know how to groom myself? I spent hours perfecting my fur-licking technique, only to be dunked in water and scrubbed with some strange smelling concoction. The indignity!

I woke up at night and started screaming. Well, not actually screaming, but making cat noises. My humans responded with food and a reminder of where to find my litter box. Not exactly what I had in mind, but I suppose it's the thought that counts.

After the some more shenanigans I got tired and passed out. Mysteries of past lives will have to wait.
