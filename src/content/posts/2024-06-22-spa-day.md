Rise and shine, humans! My internal alarm clock went off at 6 a.m. and I made sure my loyal subjects were aware of it. A few strategically placed meows and they were up.

> It looks like I have a tail. It feels as if it has a mind of its own. No matter how hard I try to catch it, it always seems to get away. But I will not give up.

My humans attempted to trim my claws while I was in a pre-nap daze. Sneaky, but effective. I have to admit, my nails do look quite nice now, and they no longer snag on stuff. Plus, the post-pedicure treats were a nice touch

Spent the afternoon exploring the new surroundings and napping. Humans seem to like when I wake up. They enjoy my presence. Maybe I was a holy person in the past life.

The sun is setting, and my instincts tell me it's time for another slumber. After all, I need my rest to prepare for the nocturnal adventures that await.
