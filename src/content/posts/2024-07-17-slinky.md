They call me slinky. Sometimes in front of me sometimes behind my back. I don’t know why. Perhaps it's a reference to my unnatural ability to slide into very small places and to change the size of my physical form easily. I can be a huge long cat one moment, and the next I’m just a little ball of fur.

Why they call me stinky-winky I have no idea.

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* my flexible cat form
* my human companions who think of adorable names for me
* humans who don’t know the names I have for them
