### Ode to a Firm Stool

Oh, the indignity! Today, I experienced the dreaded runs. Let me assure you, there's nothing quite as humbling as a backside that betrays you. Never again will I take a firm, beautiful poop for granted – that satisfying plop, the gentle wipe, the sweet smell of success. Ah, the simple joys of life.

A bit of runny poop does not scare me that much, but my human companions do not find it as adorable as my fluffy fur. I thought since it’s a part of me they would love it too. Well, you live and you learn. 

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* The firm stool, a beacon of hope in a chaotic world.
* The clean butt, a testament to hygiene and self-respect.
* Smell of no poop
