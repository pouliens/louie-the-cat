### Thrill of Exploration

I love dangerous places, places where I'm not supposed to be. Nothing gives me a greater thrill than trying to squeeze in into some tiny little corner that I haven't been before or jump on to surface that was out of my reach previously. 

My muscles are getting stronger. I can rump faster and jump higher. Is there a limit to how high I can jump? Probably no. If I had rocket boots, I could jump onto the moon. Take a short nap there, and come back to earth.

### Tight Squeezes, High Leaps

Of course, my humans don't always appreciate my adventurous spirit. They probably don't understand that it's in my blood. I need to take these risks. I need to explore. SSure, sometimes my adventures lead to less-than-ideal situations: I fall of surfaces, I get trapped in tight places. But it's all worth it. That's what I was born to do - conquer uncharted territories.

*I love being where I'm not supposed to be. That's the life of a true deep thinking criminal.*

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* Tight places
* High places
* Adrenaline in my blood that drives me to take risks
