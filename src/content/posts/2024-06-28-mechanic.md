In a past life, I'm convinced I was a car mechanic. Why? Because I share their passion for exploring the hidden depths beneath things. Just as a mechanic loves delving under the hood of a car, I love investigating the underside of beds, sofas, and wardrobes.  Who knows what treasures might be lurking there? A stray piece of string, a curious bug, or perhaps even a spider. I wish in this world everything had and accessible underside, perfect for both inspection and a quick catnap.

Whenever my humans enter a room, I delight in sliding out from under the bed on my back, like a mechanic emerging from beneath a car. It's a little ritual that connects me to my past life. I wonder what else have I been in my past lives?

### Gratitude List

Here’s what I’m feeling grateful for today:

* things that have an underside
* human's who delight in my shenanigans
* places that are only accessible to me and no one else
