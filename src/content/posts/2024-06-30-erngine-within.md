There's a miniature engine humming away inside me, activate by joy. It produces the sound of purring. I wonder, where did this engine come from? Who installed it? What what triggers its gentle rumble?

I've discovered one good way to ignite it: a good chin scratch. The sensation is so pleasurable, it sends vibrations through my entire being. This cat form I inhabit is proving to be more interesting than I imagined it would be. 

What other contraptions lie hidden within me? And do other objects in this world have things hidden inside of them as well?

*Subject A has found a way to make me purr. Must resist...*
