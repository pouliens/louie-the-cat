    description: "I wake up in the middle of the night and I get the urge to hunt. There's nothing to hunt, but I still want to do it. Strange. Who puts the feelings in my body and the thoughts in my mind? Is somebody pulling my stings?"
  
  - title: "Try to fit into tight places"
    description: "I'm not sure how big my body is, so I try to fit it into tight places learn how big this physical form I inhabit is. It's all very important scientific research. If I fits, I sits! But also, if I fits, maybe I learns how bigs I sits?"

  - title: "Nap"
    description: "I can sleep anywhere. In my dreams, I am a human - a taxi driver in Italy. Sometimes I'm not sure which life is real. I heard some philosophers say that life is a dream? Can I wake up from it? What is outside of this dream?"

I have 8 weeks of experience of being a cat. I noticed that most of the cats now have TikTok or Instagram accounts, but I'm an old fashioned cat and prefer the blog format.
